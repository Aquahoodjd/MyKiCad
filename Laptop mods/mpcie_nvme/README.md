# mPCIe-NVMe adapter

This is an adapter to easily connect NVMe drives to systems with
mPCIe slots. It will support M.2 M-key and M+B-key drives.
It's a half-height card, if you'd like to put it in a full-height slot,
you'll need a mechanical adapter of some kind.

There are traces with mask openings near the mPCIe card edge that allow you
to tap into any of the mPCIe socket pins connected to the card's pads (except the PCI-E pins).
Use them wisely!

This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.

- PCB size: 30x26.8mm
- Layer count: 2
- Recommended thickness: 1mm (won't fit in an mPCIe slot otherwise)
