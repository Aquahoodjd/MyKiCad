# Framework Display Shim

This is a start for reimplementing the Framework Mainboard.
Currently, this board is a USB-C DP altmode to Framework display adapter,
using the same connector and pinout that the Framework mainboard uses.

This adapter is currently going through the testing process, with a number of fundamental fixes scheduled for the v3 version.

## Notes

- This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I recommend a stencil for assembling this board.

## Info

- Software: Kicad 7
- Version: 2
- PCB size: w*h
- Layer count: 6
- Recommended thickness: 0.8mm/1mm (needs to match Framework mainboard thickness)
