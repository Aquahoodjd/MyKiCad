# SATAppy

This is a board that plugs straight into a SATA socket - either one that supports a regular HDD, or one that supports
a laptop sized optical disk drive. It also has a M.2 SATA SSD socket (M-key, but hey).

This board allows you to wire up a SATA cable for any purpose. You can also tap, reconnect or the full-sized SATA power connector power rails.

The SATA routing is daring - this is a 2-layer board, with stubs. There's no redrivers of any kind, either. Impedance has been kinda decreased towards
the 100 ohm target, but not fully.

Currently, the board's outline is not great. I might fix it at some point. If you'd like to manufacture the design or work off it,
contact me, I can find one of these boards I got made and make adjustments to the outline. 

## Notes

- Signal names are silkscreened on the board, top and bottom layers.
- This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I recommend a stencil for assembling this board.
