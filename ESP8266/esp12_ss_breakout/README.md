# SaferSpace ESP12 entry panel controller

This is an entry panel ESP12 controller that can connect to the TTP229 board and the shift registers for LEDs,
as well as has I2C, UART and other connectors for extra devices that can be added.

This board has 5V and 3.3V linear regulators for the base components (ESP,595,TTP229) and also various devices
that could be connected in the future. It also has an RJ45 socket with a configurable pinout that's compatible
with regular passive PoE.

This board has THT cap footprints for regulators, but you can solder SMD caps on the TH pads instead.

Signal names are not silkscreened on the board, since I was ordering it in a rush.
