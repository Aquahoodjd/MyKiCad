# Pi I2C shifter

This board level-shifts the I2C header and the GPIO to 5V using a N-FET level shifter approach.
It can be mounted to the Pi in two different orientation, so that the 5V I2C header can either stick
outside of the Pi outline or stay inside of it for a compact build.

Pin headers are arranged in a way that this board can be plugged into a breadboard from the I2C side
Signal names are silkscreened on the bottom of the board.

- PCB size: 21x14
- Layer count: 2
- Recommended thickness: 0.6mm/0.8mm (to be thin enough so that shields can be plugged on top of it)
