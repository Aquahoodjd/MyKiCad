# Touch PCB - 24mm
This board is just a simple board designed to act as a capacitative touch electrode for a large panel.
It was originally designed to work with the TTP229BSF breakout from this repository.
Its dimensions are chosen so that it's cheap to manufacture - the panel dimensions (48x48) are under the 50x50 price break
when panelized 2x2. 2x2 panel files included.

- PCB size: 24mm*24mm
- Layer count: 2
- Recommended thickness: 1.6mm (the board was tested to work well with 1.6mm, and future mechanical integrations will assume 1.6mm to
