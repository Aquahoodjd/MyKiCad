# Sony Vaio P Reverse-Engineering Effort

This project is a start for a replacement mainboard for a Sony Vaio P laptop.
There's no schematic or any traces yet, but there's scanned board images and the outline and the 
LCD connector and an approximate plan of what would fit onto this board!
Please refer to the schematic ("Sony Vaio VGN-P Series (Foxconn MBX-187)") for any info you might need,
it's more than enough.

This is, as far as I'm aware, a mobo for the Sony Vaio P720K. As far as I'm aware, it won't work well
for the previous generation, since the mobo is different shape and connectors are different.
Guess Sony wasn't all that interested in not changing every single little thing between the two generations, ohwell.

## Notes

- This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I recommend a stencil for assembling this board.

## Info

- Software: Kicad 7
- Version: 1
- PCB size: 75*65mm
- Layer count: x (currently unrouted)
- Recommended thickness: idk 1mm?
