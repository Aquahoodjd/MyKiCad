# NEP hacker board

A hacker board for a pre-determined pinout!

Has I2C and SPI flash footprints for embedded device hacking,
3.3V and 5V backflow/overcurrent protection,
two QWIIC connectors, as well as
UART/I2C/SPI/PCM audio pin headers.
SPI has series resistors,
and I2C/SPI flash auxiliary pins
are carefully pulled to their best levels.

Hope it helps!

## Notes

- Signal names are silkscreened on the board's bottom layers.
- This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I mildly recommend a stencil for assembling this board.
