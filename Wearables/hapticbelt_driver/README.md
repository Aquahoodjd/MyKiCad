# Haptic belt driver

This board uses WS2818B chips and P-FETs to drive vibromotors with PWM, 3 per board.
It uses 4-pin 0.5mm FPC connectors for power and wiring, with backup 1mm pads on the back.
The 2818 chip has a redundant signal input, but the board can surely be driven without it.

This is for a "simple DIY haptic belt" project.. hopefully it helps others as well!

## Notes

- Signal names are silkscreened on the board's bottom layers.
- This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I recommend a stencil for assembling this board.
