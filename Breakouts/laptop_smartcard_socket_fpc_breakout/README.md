# Laptop smartcard holder breakout

This is a breakout for smart card reader sockets I've found inside some laptops. It needs a 10-pin 1mm pitch FPC connector.
Smart card reader socket part number is 10010556.
Pin headers are arranged in a way that this board can be plugged into a breadboard.
Signal names are silkscreened on the board, top and bottom layers.

- PCB size: 13.25mm*26mm
