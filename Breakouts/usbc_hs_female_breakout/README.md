# USB-C socket high-speed breakout

This breakout pretends to be high-speed-compatible. better than other boards from China do.
In particular, the diffpairs are laid out as diffpairs and not as angled mess.
On the other hand, it's 2-layer and there's no impedance control attempts whatsoever.
That's because it's a 2-layer board. Use at your own risk.

The side SMD-like connector pitch is 1.27mm. There's no silkscreen pinout markings sorryyyyy refer to the board okok

This board works with KH-TYPE-C-24P-T9.87 sockets from LCSC.
Also, the through-hole pins might be too tight, your experience will vary with drill size used by your fab
and resulting through-hole plating thickness.

Insert the socket gently and don't push it too hard, make sure the needles align.
I've already ruined one socket while assembling - get extras. Good luck. I believe in you - not just on this one, but on this one too.

Text on the board says "USBCHSF brkt Arya, v2".

## Notes

- This board is kinda tested but there's no guarantees of fitness.
- I recommend a stencil for assembling this board.
