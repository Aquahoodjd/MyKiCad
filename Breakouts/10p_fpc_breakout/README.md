# 10-pin FPC/FFC breakout - 0.5/0.8/1mm

This is a simple breakout that exposes all pins of a 10-pin FFC connector.
You can do whatever with it.

On one side, there's footprints for 0.5mm and 0.8mm connectors.
On the other side, there's a footprint for 1mm connectors.

For instance, it should be quite usable for Sharp memory LCDs.
It will kinda sorta work for smaller-pin-count connectors too.

## Notes

- Pin headers are arranged in a way that this board can be plugged into a breadboard.
