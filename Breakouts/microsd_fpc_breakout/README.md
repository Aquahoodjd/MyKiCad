# MicroSD FPC breakout

This breaks out a MicroSD card to a 0.5mm FPC - you can either fit a 0.5mm pitch 8-pin connector
(shield pads available) or solder an FPC directly to this board.

This is a derivative of a third-party board from Tizen, the source can be found [here](https://git.tizen.org/cgit/tools/testlab/sd-mux/tree/doc/hardware/usd-adapter).
The LICENSE file is inherited from that project.

This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.

- PCB size: 14.2x30mm (microSD outline, so smaller)
- Layer count: 2
- Recommended thickness: 0.6mm/0.8mm (for the PCB to actually fit into a MicroSD socket; Tizen used 0.8mm, I think)
