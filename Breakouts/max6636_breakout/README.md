# MAX6636 breakout

This is a breakout for the MAX6636 IC, which is a six-channel temperature sensor ADC connectable over I2C.
This breakout gives you access to all of the connections, including 6 pairs for temperature sensing.
On the back, the board has places for pullups on all of the IC's interface signals.

Temperature sensing pairs have + and - marked on the silkscreen, over the pins.
The I2C pinout is the default Raspberry Pi pinout - VCC-SDA-SCL-ALRT-GND.
The extra signals (OVERT and STBY) are available on an extra pin header and have an abbreviation silkscreened.

This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.

- PCB size: 21x17mm
- Layer count: 2
