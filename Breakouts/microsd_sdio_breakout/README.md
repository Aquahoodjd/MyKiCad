# MicroSD SDIO breakout 

A MicroSD SDIO breakout with data-to-VCC pullups, card detect and decoupling capacitor.
Inspired by [a long-sold-out Tindie listing](https://www.tindie.com/products/gtalusan/microsdtf-breakout-with-pull-up-resistors/)

If you need to disable the CD pullup, you can use a hot air gun and shift the bottom resistor pack up by one resistor.
Pin headers are arranged in a way that this board can be plugged into a breadboard.
Signal names are silkscreened on the board's bottom layer, which is flat - all the components are on the bottom of the board for PnP optimization.
There's a 0805 footprint between card shield and card GND.

- PCB size: 23,5*23,5mm
- Layer count: 2
