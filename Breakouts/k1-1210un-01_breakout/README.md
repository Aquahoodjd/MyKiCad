# K1-1210UN-01 switch breakout 

This is a small breakout for the K1-1210UN-01 five-direction SMD switch.
I made it so that it's easler to wire this switch in different configurations
while still retaining the small footprint.

This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.

- PCB size: 12*12.5mm
- Layer count: 2
