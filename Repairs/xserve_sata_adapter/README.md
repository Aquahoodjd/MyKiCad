# XServe SSD connector to M.2 B-key SSD adapter

This is a board that takes a (reverse-engineered) SATA SSD connector on the Apple Xserve board
and connects a B-key M.2 SSD slot to it. It's REed without having the adapter on hand, using
the pinout information available online and filling in the gaps where needed.

Power signal names are silkscreened on the board's bottom layer.
This board is untested and there's no guarantees of fitness.

- PCB size: 24x26mm
- Layer count: 2
- Recommended thickness: low (if the adapter is too thick, the server lid might not close).
