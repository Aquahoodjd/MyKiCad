# Simple NPN driver

A simple small driver board with an NPN transistor that can be used to drive a small relay, motor or other device.
Has a base resistor and a pulldown resistor from IN, a diode to limit backwards EMF, as well as a capacitor between GND and VCC.
Also has a small 0R 0603 resistor in series with VCC that acts as a pseudo-fuse.
